# CHESS - ETL Project

## Project Proposal

* Country with the highest rated players
* Best players from each country for a specific year
* Compare change in rating between 2 or more years
* Which age group has the best rating overall (every 10 years)
## Research Question
* Which country has the best chess players during 2020? 
* Does age play a role in chess rankings? Compare results between the 2 years.  

## Finding Data

With our project we decided to use 2 data sources. This is the site were we collected our data:

* [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/rohanrao/chess-fide-ratings)


### Project Instructions
### Data Cleanup & Analysis

Once you have identified your datasets, perform ETL on the data. Make sure to plan and document the following:

* The sources of data that you will extract from.

* The type of transformation needed for this data (cleaning, joining, filtering, aggregating, etc).

* The type of final production database to load the data into (relational or non-relational).

* The final tables or collections that will be used in the production database.

You will be required to submit a final technical report with the above information and steps required to reproduce your ETL process.

### Project Report

At the end of the week, your team will submit a Final Report that describes the following:

* **E**xtract: your original data sources and how the data was formatted (CSV, JSON, pgAdmin 4, etc).

* **T**ransform: what data cleaning or transformation was required.

* **L**oad: the final database, tables/collections, and why this was chosen.

Please upload the report to Github and submit a link to Bootcampspot.
